<h1>Hello, my name is Tyler Robinson and welcome to my Github!</h1>

<p>I am a Software Engineer who's working towards becoming a Full-Stacks Engineer! When I was a kid, I always wanted to code ever since I was a kid. The spark started when I had my hands on Sega Genesis and ever since then, I have been trying to get myself to learn how to make a game. First I needed to learn how to code which I have struggled with for a while since there are many programming languages to learn. When I heard of Resilient Coders, I jumped right into it eager to learn more about software engineering and eventually Full-Stacks so I can pursue my career in this industry.</p>
